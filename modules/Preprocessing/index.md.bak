# Preprocessing

This module process the data based on the various inputs that the package has.

## Contents

```@contents
Pages = ["index.md"]
```

## Index

```@index
Pages = ["index.md"]
```

## Usage

```julia
using CSV, DataFrames
using ModelSelection: Preprocessing

data = CSV.read("data.csv", DataFrame)

modelselection_data = input(equation, data)
```

## Parameters

### `equation::String`
The equation represents the relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is used to model and predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.

```julia
# Stata-like string
equation = "y x1 x2 x3"

# R-like string
equation = "y ~ x1 + x2 + x3"

# Strings separated with comma
equation = "y,x1,x2,x3"

# Vector of strings
equation = ["y", "x1", "x2", "x3"]

# Vector of symbols
equation = [:y, :x1, :x2, :x3]

# Using wildcards
equation = "y *"
equation = "y x*"
equation = "y x1 z*"
equation = "y ~ x*"
equation = "y ~ ."
```

### `data::::Union{Array{Float64}, Array{Float32}, Array{Union{Float64,Missing}}, Array{Union{Float32,Missing}}, Tuple, DataFrame}`
The "data" refers to the set of observations or samples used to estimate the coefficients of the regression equation and make predictions. It consists of pairs of values for the dependent variable and the independent variables.

```julia
# As an array
data = [1.0 2.0 3.0; 4.0 5.0 6.9]

# As a tuple
data = ([1.0 2.0 3.0; 4.0 5.0 6.9], [:x1, :x2, :x3])

# As a DataFrame
data = DataFrame(x1 = [1.0 2.0 3.0], x2 = [4.0 5.0 6.0])
```

### `method::Symbol`
Defines the datatype of the data, to be faster and lightweight or precise and heavyweight.
If :fast is selected, the data is converted to a lightweight data type (Float32).
If :precise is selected, the data is converted to a precise data type (Float64).

```julia
# Lightweight and faster
method = :fast

# Heavyweight and precise
method = :precise
```
